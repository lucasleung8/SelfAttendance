# AutomateAttendance

Small tool built with Selenium that automatically fills out the Google Forms attendance sheet for my ICS4U/TEJ4M classes, saving ~10s each day. The same exact cell needs to be filled each school day, thus automation is simple.

> Note: this does **not** run automatically! This script just automates opening and typing into the spreadsheet. So each day that you're present, you have to run the script.

## Features
- Cross-browser
- Cross-platform
- Fast and efficent
- It's one less thing to worry about during the day so you can focus on what actually matters

## Instructions
- Download main.py
- Open it and edit the user config options to your desired customization. **Add in the link to your cell in the spreadsheet**.
    - NOTE: to get your cell, Right click it>View more cell options>Get link to this cell
- Run the script, et voila
